# MeetYourMentor_Flask_Python_MongoDB
Meet your mentor is a website application which aims to reduce impediments in the education section.
It is a platform where mentors and students can benefit from each other. It will be a lot easier for them to communicate with each other online or offline.
Students or mentors can search for their requirements easily on this site. Also, they connect and fulfil their needs.

The "demand" for the online education market has substantially expanded. This kind of education is becoming more and more popular
since it allows students to keep studying while sat in the comfort of their own homes. This feeds the high demand for these kinds of applications.
The software companies provide a huge and constantly expanding selection of online applications.

We were inspired to create this website since there was no reliable method of finding mentors or even students.
Typically, individuals are too busy to have adequate time, whether they live in a rural location or not.
Everyone wants to save time. This website assists such individuals, satisfies their needs,
and offers a useful way for them to identify students who can serve as mentors or find a mentor in a certain field.

The website is excellent for home tutoring since all of the mentors offered on its online platform are recognized to have been individually chosen by the company.
Schedule one, and the mentor will show up at the student's location at the scheduled time. Parents and pupils are kept at rest in this manner.
